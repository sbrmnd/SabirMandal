OOPs Concepts
---------------
What is Object Oriented Programming?
What are main features of OOP?
Encapsution, Abstruction, Inheritance and Polymorphism
What is Polymorphism? How is it supported by C++?
What are VTABLE and VPTR?
Difference between Copy constructor and Assignment Operator overloading.
Virtual Destruction.
Differences between malloc() and operator new.
What is Static Member?
Casting Dynamic_cast, static_cast, and reint, const_cast

Programing questions:

--------------------------------------------------
Finding the Sum of all Odd Frequency Elements in an Array

For example, 
Consider an array arr = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3}
Here, elements 1 and 2 repeats twice (even), whereas elements 4, 5, 6 are present only once (odd) and element 3 occurs thrice (odd). Hence,

Elements having odd frequency : {4, 5, 6, 3, 3, 3}
Sum of elements having odd frequency: 24

Link list

Inserting element in the end.
Reverse the link list.
Implement Stack.
-----------------------

Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.

4
1 5 3 2

3
3 2 7

Output:
2
-1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: There are 2 triplets: 1 + 2 = 3 and 3 +2 = 5

static private int SumOftriplets(int size, int[] array)
    {
        List<int> list = new List<int>(array);
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i =0; i< size; i++)
        {
            for(int j= 0; j< size; j++)
            {
                if(array[i]!=array[j])
                {
                    int sum = a[i]+a[j];
                    if(list.Contains(sum))
                    {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

MFC questions.
--------------
What is windows programming? How it’s working?
What are class involved while creating MFC Application.
CWinApp, CFrameWnd
How Message Map works in an MFC application?

Q What’s the difference between PostMessage and SendMessage?

The PostMessage function places (posts) a message in the message queue associated with
the thread that created the specified window and then returns without waiting for the
thread to process the message.
The SendMessage function sends the specified message to a window or windows. The
function calls the window procedure for the specified window and does not return until the
window procedure has processed the message.

Q Name the Synchronization objects ?
________________________________________
Following are the synchronization objects
1) Critical Section 2) Event 3) Mutex 4) Semaphore
Classes provided for above synchronization objects are:
1) CCriticalSection 2) CEvent 3) CMutex 4) CSemaphore

Q What is the difference between regular dlls and extended dlls?

Regular dlls wraps only the c/c++ functions. Where extention dlls include c++ interfaces
where we can create the objects of it and use in our classes. Extended dlls support object
oriented concepts.Regural dlls uses mfc internally and exported functions can be used by
any mfc or non-mfc applications.Extention dlls implements reusable classes derived from
mfc library,built using dll version of mfc.Only mfc executables(applications/dll-shared
version of mfc) can use extention dlls.extention dlls used for passing mfc derived objects
b/w applications and dlls. Regulardlls

Q Can you explain the Document-View architecture in MFC ?

Q Create a UI Threads.

SQL questions.
------------------
What is unique key constraint.
What is diffence between primary key costraint and unique key constraint?
What are joins in SQL?
Diffence between cluster and non-cluster index.
Store procedure? can store procedure parameter 

Write a SQL query to get the third highest salary of an employee from employee_table?

SELECT TOP 1 salary
FROM(
SELECT TOP 3 salary
FROM employee_table
ORDER BY salary DESC) AS emp
ORDER BY salary ASC;

SELECT Salary
FROM Worker W1
WHERE 4 = (
 SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT ( W2.Salary ) )
 FROM Worker W2
 WHERE W2.Salary >= W1.Salary
 );

Delete duplicate row in SQL

What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE statements?
